Revision history for KSx::Highlight::Summarizer

0.03    14 March, 2008
        One bug fix:  In ‘page break mode’  (when there is a page han-
        dler),  an excerpt that trails on to the next  page  is  trun-
        cated  (starting excerpt_length * 2/3 chars before the end of
        the excerpt)  to just before the page break  (this is  a  fea-
        ture).  Before,  the text from the starting point up to  (and
        including) the page break would be deleted instead.
