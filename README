KSx::Highlight::Summarizer, version 0.02 (beta)

This module is a subclass of KinoSearch::Highlight::Highlighter that
offers more possibilities for customisation:

• Summaries (multiple excerpts for a document, joined with ellipses)
• Pagination
• Custom ellipsis marks


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

This module has been updated to work with the latest working copy of
KinoSearch (revision 3099), and no longer works with revisions earlier
than 3091. This has also made some API changes necessary:
•  The constructor’s ‘encoder’ arg now expects a code ref.
• ‘formatter’ has been replaced with ‘pre_tag’ and ‘post_tag’.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install KSx::Highlight::Summarizer"

    [sudo] cpan KSx::Highlight::Summarizer

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl and the following Perl modules:

• Number::Range
• Hash::Util::FieldHash::Compat
• The development version of KinoSearch, which one can get from
  http://www.rectangular.com/svn/kinosearch/trunk/. This module has
  only been tested with revision 3096.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc KSx::Highlight::Summarizer

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man KSx::Highlight::Summarizer
