KSx::Highlight::Summarizer, version 0.04 (beta)

This module is a subclass of KinoSearch::Highlight::Highlighter that
offers more possibilities for customisation:

• Summaries (multiple excerpts for a document, joined with ellipses)
• Pagination
• Custom ellipsis marks


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Just bug fixes:
• A highlighted word at the beginning or end of an indexed field used
  to warn in page break mode.
• In summary and page break mode,  an ellipsis at  the  end  of  one
  excerpt would cause the start of  the  following  excerpt,  if  it
  occurred on another page, not to be trimmed to a word boundary and
  not to have an ellipsis mark after the page marker,  unless  there
  were a sentence boundary to trim to.
