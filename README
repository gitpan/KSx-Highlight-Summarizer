KSx::Highlight::Summarizer, version 0.03 (beta)

This module is a subclass of KinoSearch::Highlight::Highlighter that
offers more possibilities for customisation:

• Summaries (multiple excerpts for a document, joined with ellipses)
• Pagination
• Custom ellipsis marks


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• This module now requires revision 3118 or later of KinoSearch.
• One bug has been fixed:  In ‘page break mode’ (when there is a page
  handler),  an excerpt that trails on to the next page is  truncated
  (starting excerpt_length * 2/3 chars before the end of the excerpt)
  to just before the page break (this is a feature). Before, the text
  from the starting point up to (and including)  the page break would
  be deleted instead.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
