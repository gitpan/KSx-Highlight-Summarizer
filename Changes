0.04    26 March, 2008
        Just bug fixes:
      • A highlighted word at the beginning or end of an indexed field
        used to warn in page break mode.
      • In summary and page break mode,  an ellipsis at the end of one
        excerpt would cause the start of the following excerpt,  if it
        occurred on another page, not to be trimmed to a word boundary
        and not to have an ellipsis mark after the page marker, unless
        there were a sentence boundary to trim to.

0.03    14 March, 2008
        One bug fix:  In ‘page break mode’  (when there is a page han-
        dler),  an excerpt that trails on to the next  page  is  trun-
        cated  (starting excerpt_length * 2/3 chars before the end of
        the excerpt)  to just before the page break  (this is  a  fea-
        ture).  Before,  the text from the starting point up to  (and
        including) the page break would be deleted instead.
